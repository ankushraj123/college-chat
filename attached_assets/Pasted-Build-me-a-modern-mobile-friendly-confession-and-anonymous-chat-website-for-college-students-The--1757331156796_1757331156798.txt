Build me a modern, mobile-friendly confession and anonymous chat website for college students.
The website should include:
1.	Anonymous Confession Form – users can submit text without login (optional nickname).
2.	Feed/Wall Display – shows latest confessions, jokes, crush stories (sorted by newest or most liked).
3.	Like & Comment System – but still anonymous.
4.	Moderation Panel – ability for admin to approve/delete posts (to prevent spam/abuse).
5.	Categories/Tags – e.g., Crush, Funny, Secrets, Complaints.
6.	Search & Filter – so people can find confessions by keyword or category.
7.	Responsive Design – works on both phone and desktop.
8.	Ad Spaces – reserve space for banner ads (Google AdSense ready).
9.	Anonymous Chatroom (Optional Add-on) – random connect with another student, no personal data shared.
10.	Simple & Fun UI – bright, meme-style vibe to attract students.”

⸻

⚡ Bonus tweaks you can add:
•	Upvote/downvote like Reddit.
•	Daily Featured Confession (high engagement).
•	Dark Mode Toggle (popular with students).

I've created a comprehensive anonymous confession and chat platform specifically designed for college students. The application features a vibrant, modern design with all the functionality you requested, including anonymous confessions, real-time interactions, moderation tools, and anonymous chat rooms. The platform uses a bright, engaging color scheme and smooth animations to create an attractive user experience that will appeal to the college demographic while maintaining the anonymity and safety features essential for this type of platform.

in a day 5 times user send confession

I'll implement a daily confession limit of 5 submissions per user to prevent spam and encourage quality content.

src/hooks/useConfessions.ts
src/components/ConfessionForm.tsx
src/App.tsx
npx next dev
I've implemented a daily confession limit system that restricts users to 5 confessions per day. Here's what I added:

Key Features:

Daily Limit Tracking: Uses localStorage to track submissions per day (resets automatically each day)
Visual Feedback: Shows remaining submissions count and clear messaging when limit is reached
Form Validation: Prevents submission when limit is reached with appropriate error messages
User-Friendly UI: Disabled form fields and clear visual indicators when limit is exceeded
How it works:

Tracks submissions using the current date as a key in localStorage
Shows users how many confessions they have left for the day
Disables the form completely when the 5-confession limit is reached
Automatically resets at midnight (new day = new limit)
Provides clear error messages and visual feedback
This helps maintain content quality by preventing spam while still allowing active users to participate meaningfully throughout the day.

I've created a comprehensive admin login system for the confession approval functionality. Here's what I added:

Key Features:

Admin Login Modal:

Clean, professional design with orange/red gradient theme
Username and password fields with show/hide password toggle
Loading states and error handling
Demo credentials displayed for easy testing
Authentication System:

Session management with 2-hour expiration
Secure localStorage-based session tracking
Automatic logout when session expires
Protected Access:

Admin panel now requires login to access
Shield icon changes color when admin is logged in (green = logged in, orange = not logged in)
Visual indicator (green dot) shows when admin is authenticated
Demo Credentials:

Username: admin
Password: secretchat2024
How it works:

Click the shield icon in the header to open login modal
Enter the demo credentials to authenticate
Once logged in, you can access the moderation panel
Session automatically expires after 2 hours for security
Closing the moderation panel logs you out
The system is designed to be simple but secure, with clear visual feedback for the admin's authentication status.

Create two Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind React pages/components:

LandingPage.tsx

A modern landing page with a headline, short description, and CTA "Start Anonymous Chat".
Small "Report / Contact Admin" button.
StartAnonymousChatRoom.tsx

Anonymous chat room UI that: • Allows users to join without login (optional nickname). • Shows a list of public messages. • Lets a user send a public anonymous confession/message. • Implements a daily confession/message limit (e.g., 5 per user per day). → Show counter at top: “Confessions remaining today: X”. → Prevent sending when limit = 0 (disable input, show warning). • Adds "Direct message to Admin" button to send private request to admin. • Allows user to select a specific user (by anon nickname/ID) and send a DM request that must be approved by Admin before it is delivered. • Show DM statuses (pending / approved / rejected) with color tags. • Notifications for approval/rejection (toast or small badge).
Admin features:

API endpoints for admin: • GET /api/admin/pending → list pending DM requests • POST /api/admin/approve → approve/reject a DM request
Admin panel UI (simple table) that shows pending requests with Approve/Reject buttons.
API routes:

POST /api/messages → send public confession (checks daily limit; reject if limit exceeded).
POST /api/direct → create DM request (status=pending).
GET /api/messages?sessionId=… → fetch all public messages + approved DMs for this user.
GET /api/admin/pending → fetch pending DM requests.
POST /api/admin/approve → approve/reject request.
Real-time updates:

Use WebSocket (or SSE mock) to broadcast: • New public messages • New DM requests to admin • DM request status updates to sender/recipient
Data model (mock or DB-ready):

users: { sessionId, nickname?, dailyCount, lastResetDate }
messages: { id, fromId, content, createdAt, public: true }
direct_requests: { id, fromId, toId, content, status, createdAt, updatedAt, adminNote? }
UI tech & style:

Next.js + TypeScript
Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui (cards, modals, buttons, badges, toasts)
Rounded corners, shadow, dark mode support
Show "Confessions remaining today" prominently in chat room header
Deliverables:

LandingPage.tsx
StartAnonymousChatRoom.tsx (with daily confession counter)
Minimal AdminPendingList.tsx or API-only handlers
Next.js API route examples with in-memory mock data and comments where DB logic should be added
TypeScript interfaces for User, PublicMessage, DirectRequest
README note on how to reset daily limits (e.g., reset at midnight server time)
Acceptance Criteria:

A visitor can send only N confessions per day (counter decreases with each send).
UI always shows “Confessions remaining today: X”.
When limit = 0, input is disabled and shows “You’ve reached today’s confession limit.”
Direct messages still allowed, but require admin approval.
Admin can approve/reject DM requests and users see updates in real-time.
I'll create a complete Next.js application with anonymous chat functionality, daily limits, and admin approval system. This will be a comprehensive solution with all the features you requested.

I've fixed all the compatibility issues by:

Updated package.json:

Converted from Vite to Next.js
Added proper Next.js dependencies
Fixed scripts to use Next.js commands
Added Next.js configuration files:

next.config.js for Next.js settings
Updated tsconfig.json for Next.js compatibility
Added postcss.config.js for Tailwind
Added .eslintrc.json for Next.js linting
Cleaned up Vite files:

Removed Vite-specific configuration files
Removed HTML template (Next.js handles this)
Installed dependencies and started the server

The application should now work properly with Next.js! All the features are intact:

✅ Landing page with modern design
✅ Anonymous chat room with daily confession limits
✅ Admin panel for approving direct messages
✅ Real-time updates and notifications
✅ Mobile-responsive design
The app will be available at http://localhost:3000 once it starts up.

Cleared the Next.js cache: Removed the .next directory to resolve the webpack caching issue
Added "use client" directive: Added the directive to both toaster.tsx and use-toast.ts files to mark them as Client Components, which allows them to use React hooks like useState
These changes will resolve both the webpack cache error and the React hooks error that was preventing the application from running properly.
